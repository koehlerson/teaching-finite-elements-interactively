# Teaching Finite Elements Interactively

---

# Who I am

PhD student at Chair of Continuum Mechanics, Ruhr-University Bochum

- German courses consist (most of of the time) of lectures and exercises
- As a master student, I enjoyed two machine learning courses which were taught exclusively by jupyter notebooks and inverted classroom principle

## Motivation

- Create interactive notebooks that cover the concepts of finite elements
- Set up a centralized environment for the students that I can fully control
- The environment needs to be accessible by a browser at any time

# JupyterHub Server with Pluto Proxy

- Let some service do the user management, in this case JupyterHub
- Install packages in a shared directory: change the JULIA_DEPOT_PATH variable

- [Repo with JupyterLab Extension](https://github.com/fonsp/pluto-on-jupyterlab)

# Visualizing Results of Finite Element Computation

# Outlook

1. Find a better way to check tasks with index notation
2. Translate the material to english
3. Setup different tracks for mathematics, physics, computer science and engineering students
4. Publish it
